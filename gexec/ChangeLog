	* Modified xinetd file to set LD_ASSUME_KERNEL="2.2.5" to deal
	  with LinuxThreads not implementing all POSIX cancellation
	  points.
	* Modified gexec.spec.in to use a build root so RedHat 9's
	  broken version of rpmbuild builds without the infamous
	  "getOutputFrom(): Broken pipe" error.
2002-08-07  Brent N. Chun  <bnc@caltech.edu>
	* Fixed stdin forwarding bug to handle rare case where stdin is
          being forwarded to processes that have already exited.
2002-04-29  Brent N. Chun  <bnc@caltech.edu>
	* Added Matt Massie's patch for pointer arithmetic for

        * Binary RPM now linked with Ganglia v2.3.0b6 instead of 
	  Ganglia v2.3.0b5 which contained a bug. This applies
          to GEXEC 0.3.3.
2002-04-20  Brent N. Chun  <bnc@caltech.edu>
	* Try localhost:8649 for gmond if GEXEC_SVRS and GEXEC_GMOND_SVRS
	  not set and code compiled with GANGLIA.
	* Added GEXEC_NO_HOSTS_ERROR
	* Fixed bug in ips_create_ganglia (was reusing i in inner loop)
	* Added error messages for chdir, exec on remote node after fork
2002-04-19  Brent N. Chun  <bnc@caltech.edu>
	* Using cluster.gexec_hosts (only gexec hosts)
	* Added #ifdef GANGLIA to call to set_gexec_svrs so GEXEC
	  compiles when Ganglia not enabled
2002-04-18  Brent N. Chun  <bnc@caltech.edu>
	* Now setting GEXEC_SVRS based on servers returned by gmond
	* Using err_quiet() function to suppress Ganglia error messages
	* Now supporting host:port syntax for GMOND_SVRS
2002-03-22  Brent N. Chun  <bnc@caltech.edu>
	* Added optional node selection using Ganglia (autoconf option 
	  to enable --enable-ganglia), GEXEC_GMOND_SVRS to use)
2002-03-21  Brent N. Chun  <bnc@caltech.edu>
	* Fixed memory leak (free for get_current_dir_name) in request.c
	* Fixed memory leak (xfree's for argv,envp buf) in request.c
2002-03-18  Brent N. Chun  <bnc@caltech.edu>
	* Fixed double xfree in gexecd_thr when inetd option usd
	* Changes based on <david.lombard@mscsoftware.com>'s patch
	  * Added -h (help) and -V (version) options to gexec
	  * Fanout now uses '-f' instead of '-F' to be consistent with pcp
	  * -n 0 now means all hosts in GEXEC_SVRS
	  * Fixed typo (detatched -> detached)
	  * Using valid exit codes, convention is roughly 
	    * 0 (success)
	    * 1 (base error, i.e., things in libc/pthreads lib)
	    * 2 (gexec error, i.e,. things in my code)
	    * 3 (user error, i.e., user errors such as bad options)
	* Print error if not enough hosts in GEXEC_SVRS (gexec.c)
2002-03-11  Brent N. Chun  <bnc@caltech.edu>
	* Initial release
